# Firebase Legacy Archive

This folder contains Firebase-related code and config removed from active runtime paths.

- Archived on: 2026-02-25
- Reason: decommission Firebase from the app and standardize on Django + PostgreSQL (Render).
- Scope archived:
  - Firebase Cloud Functions source/build files
  - Firestore rules/index config
  - Firebase setup/verification scripts
  - Firebase-specific frontend tests and legacy stubs

These files are kept for historical reference only and are not used by the current app.

  Tuutta is an AI-powered educational platform with chat tutoring, note-taking,
  file uploads, assessments, and gamification features. The app builds
  successfully but has several areas needing completion.

  Key Areas for Improvement

  1. Critical Issues

  API Keys Exposed in .env
  - Your OpenAI API key and Google API keys are hardcoded and likely
  expired/invalid
  - Action needed: Move these to environment variables, never commit to git

  Bundle Size (2.6MB)
  - Main JavaScript bundle is extremely large
  - Fix: Implement code splitting with dynamic imports for heavy libraries
  (PDF.js, OpenAI, etc.)

  Missing Backend Infrastructure
  - Supabase integration exists but no database schema/tables defined
  - Netlify functions referenced but not all implemented
  - Need: Complete backend setup for data persistence

  2. Incomplete Features

  Assessment System
  - Components exist but integration is partial
  - Missing: Score tracking, progress analytics, adaptive difficulty
  - Files: src/components/AssessmentPanel.tsx, src/lib/assessment.ts

  File Processing
  - PDF, DOCX, Excel support added but likely untested
  - OCR with Tesseract.js included but no UI for image uploads
  - Web scraping via Netlify function needs testing

  Analytics Dashboard
  - AnalyticsDashboard.tsx exists but likely shows mock data
  - Missing: Real data aggregation from user activities

  Gamification
  - Achievements, XP, streaks, levels implemented in store
  - Missing: Proper triggers for unlocking achievements across features

  3. Code Quality Issues

  State Management
  - Over-reliance on localStorage for all user data
  - Should use Supabase for persistence and sync
  - Current setup won't scale or sync across devices

  Type Safety
  - Some any types in the codebase
  - Missing error boundaries for React components

  Performance
  - No lazy loading for components
  - Heavy dependencies loaded upfront
  - Missing React.memo for expensive renders

  4. Missing Core Features

  - User Profile Management: No avatar, bio, or preferences beyond settings
  - Search Functionality: lib/search.ts exists but not integrated
  - Social Features: No collaboration, sharing, or multi-user support
  - Mobile Optimization: Responsive but not optimized for mobile interactions
  - Offline Support: No service worker or offline capabilities
  - Error Handling: Inconsistent error handling across components

  5. Security Concerns

  - API keys in frontend (should be server-side only)
  - No rate limiting on API calls
  - Authentication relies on Supabase but missing row-level security policies

  Recommended Next Steps

  1. Secure API keys - Move to Netlify environment variables
  2. Complete Supabase setup - Define database schema for notes, chats,
  assessments, files
  3. Implement code splitting - Reduce initial bundle size
  4. Complete assessment flow - End-to-end testing and scoring
  5. Add error boundaries - Better error handling UI
  6. Test file processing - Verify PDF, DOCX, image OCR work correctly
  7. Analytics implementation - Connect dashboard to real data
  8. Achievement triggers - Hook gamification into user actions
  9. Testing - Add unit and integration tests
  10. Documentation - Update README with setup instructions

  Would you like me to help you tackle any specific area first? I'd recommend
  starting with securing the API keys and setting up proper backend
  infrastructure.
